Greetings, I hope the following provides thorough answers to the questions in the mock analysis. There are R scripts that will
walk you through the details of each analysis, as well as the .RData that can be loaded with the R scripts to run
through the analyses on your end. I have also included additional files I generated to process the RNA-seq data, which are not
necessary, unless you want to run through the R scripts on your end. 

The files and their purposes are as follows:

Q1-4. - The script used to generate the answer to questions 1 through 4 
Q1-4.RData - The .RData that for questions 1 through 4 
Q5_DEG_from_raw_files.docx - A detailed explaination that answers question 5 and references Q5_DEG_from_raw_files.R.
Q5_DEG_from_raw_files.R - The script that is referenced in Q5_DEG_from_raw_files.docx
Consensus Results - The results of Q1.
Boxplots.png - The results of Q2
MA Plot.png - The results of Q3
Volcano Plot.png - The results of Q3

Additional files:
data_Moffitt_basal25.csv - A file used in Q1-4.R (In case you want to run throught the script yourself)
data_Moffitt_classical25.csv - A file used in Q1-4.R (In case you want to run throught the script yourself)
raw_counts.csv - A file used in Q1-4.R (In case you want to run throught the script yourself)
